This is the enhanced corsair-psu hwmon driver which includes some features
which will never be part of the mainline kernel. It can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the mainline driver.

But be aware, this is experimental code and not every commit of this version
will run without problems. It is a playground to test new stuff.
