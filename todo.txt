userspace tool:
- rmi-hxi-query (done)
  Is a tool which can query the micro-controller of the HXi/RMi series, which
  basically works the same way the driver does. But it runs in userspace, uses
  the hidapi lib and does not need the driver at all.

enhanced corsair-psu driver: (partly done)
  It is the same driver as the mainline driver but with enhanced functionality,
  which is discouraged in kernel space. It supports calculating input current
  (just a proof of concept - actually a wild guess based on efficiency curves
  from the PSU manuals) and reporting over-current-protection status (will make
  it switchable in debugfs). Fan control will be added, too. Add collecting of
  statistical data (at least per session) which is actually supported by the
  hwmon subsystem.

Get support up for the AXi series:

1B1C 1C00 Controller for Corsair Link            AX760i, AX860i, AX1200i
1B1C 1C01 ?
1B1C 1C02 Corsair AX1500i
1B1C 1C11 Corsair AX1600i

The USB dongles for the AXi series actually use a plain cp210x usb-serial bridge
but only connectable to the AXi series PSUs by a propreitary connector. The
first USB ID is already part of the cp210x driver. There are two possible ways
to go to get this driver done. Writing a driver attaching to tty subsystem and
these USB ids or replicate some functionality of the cp210x driver and add the
hwmon stuff.
